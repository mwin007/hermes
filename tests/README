You need to install phpunit and test_helpers extension in order to execute the tests.
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
pecl install phpunit/test_helpers

You need to enable the test_helpers extension on your php.ini file. (extension=test_helpers.so)
Note: If you are using xdebug extension, you might need to add the following line AFTER loading xdebug extension:
zend_extension=/full/path/to/test_helpers.so

In order to get the semantic integration tests working you need to import the create_database.sql file. (TBD).

In order to generate a coverage report, run the following command:
phpunit --coverage-html ./report .

In order to run separated testsuites, you can run:
sh run_tests.sh

In order to add a pre-commit hook to prevent commits that would break the tests:
1. Go to hermes root
2. Create a symlink on the hooks folder pointing to the test runner:
    ln -s ../../tests/run_tests.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
3. You are done, now before you can commit all the tests will be executed no test can fail.
